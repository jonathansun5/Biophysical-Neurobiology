\item
The traces shown in the figure below represent synaptic currents measured under voltage clamp. The given voltages are the holding potentials with respect to the resting potential.

\newpage
\item
You are voltage-clamping a neuromuscular junction at $-80 \text{mV}$ (perfect space clamp), and you measure the following end-plate currents in response to low-frequency nerve stimulation: (EPCs, in nA) $0.3$, $0.5$, $0.7$, $1.1$, $1.5$, $1.1$, $0.9$, $1.3$, $1.1$, $0.5$, $0.5$, $0.7$, $0.7$, $1.1$, $0.5$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $1.3$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
If you assume that $E_s = 0 \text{mV}$, what is the approximate synaptic conductance?

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.

\newpage
\item
You have found that two putative neurotransmitters (X and Y) cause depolarization of isolated retinal horizontal cells and that both responses reverse at $0 \text{mV}$. You want to determine whether X and Y use the same or different ligand-gated channels. You obtain the following results. In voltage clamp at $V_{\text{rest}}$, a saturating concentration of X alone causes a $2 \text{nA}$ inward current, and a saturating concentration of Y alone also causes a $2 \text{nA}$ inward current. Also, $G_{\text{rest}} = 10 \text{nS}$ and $V_{\text{rest}} = -100 \text{mV}$. Assume that there is no desensitization and that the neuron is passive (no voltage-dependent conductances).
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
If X and Y use the same channels, calculate the expected membrane potential (under current clamp) with X alone, with Y alone, and with X and Y together. Similarly, calculate the expected total current under voltage clamp at $V_{\text{rest}}$ when X and Y are applied together.
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.













\item
Repeat part (a) for the expected results if X and Y use different channels.
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.

\newpage
\item
For this problem, it is convenient to think about an equivalent circuit of the receptor cell that illustrates the action of stimulating light.

This problem concerns single visual cells in the ocellus of a barnacle (Brown, Hagiwara, Koike \& Meech, $1970$). Two glass microelectrods were inserted into the cell, one to record membrane potential and the other to pass inward or outward current pulses. At the same time a standard flash of light could be given (Fig. $13.5$).
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{/Users/jonathansun5/Documents/Fall 2017/MCB 166/Homeworks/HW 6/Screen Shot 2017-11-30 at 12.08.22 AM.png}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
Draw a text-figure graph of membrane potential against stimulus current, plotting curves for the receptor in the dark and after $0.5$ sec in the light during the flashes.
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.












\item
What is the input resistance of the cell in the light and in the dark?
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.












\item
Give an approximate value for the time constant  of the membrane in the dark, and deduce a value for the membrane capacitance in the dark.
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.












\item
What is the reversal potential?
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.











\item
What conductance change for which ion or ions is most likely to be the effect of illumination?
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.












\item
Is there any clear evidence for (i) electrical excitability and (ii) rectification in the membrane?
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.












\item
If you assume that the cells are spherical with a diameter of $100 \mu\text{m}$, what would be the specific membrane resistance in the dark?
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.












\item
Microvilli are known to be present on the cells; how would this fact affect your estimate of specific membrane resistance?
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
\\
ok.

\newpage
\item
A neuron contains $N$ identical channels that are gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate opens these channels and results in an inward \ch{Na+} current ($E_{\ch{Na}} = +50 \text{mV}$). The glutamate-induced currents in this neuron under voltage-clamp conditions ($V_{\ch{P}} = 10 \text{mV}$) are given in the following diagram:
